If you ever see a group of boys in a group all on their phones, there are two things they are looking at. They are either comparing fantasy football lineups, or trading stocks. These two hobbies have a lot in common. Fantasy football enthusiasts are some of the most complex statisticians out there. They are chasing a prize pool at the end of the season. Investors are right there with them, chasing returns that exceed the market indices. The hobby of fantasy football aside, why is it that young men seem to be drawn to numbers, bets, and money? 
<br>
This question can be blown up to a much larger macro-scale: What is our purpose as young men – particularly the young men studying business? 
<br>
Business schools will teach you how to complete a task – how do I use the VLOOKUP function, create a financial report, what column does this expense go in? In the end, we become qualified for middle management. Middle management is not the dream of any self-starter, any entrepreneur, or dreamer. We are programmed to build, to lead, and to explore, and yet are churned out as task performers. 
<br>
Truly, the very nature of men has been suppressed, sacrificed in exchange for a $70,000 salary. How do men react to this? The institutions of business do not change for the few who reject this lifestyle, so those men have found a way out. 
<br>
I stated that groups of men crowded around a phone are most likely either comparing fantasy football lineups, or stock portfolios. The platform, or even category, of virtual “competition”, virtual “work”, virtual “escape routes”, do not matter. What matters is that they are, at the core, escape routes.
<br>
I am a student, which means my 40 hours a week are spent in the classroom. Yes, this is an investment of its own kind; I hope to leverage that degree to reach a higher salary, better quality of life, etc. To do this though, we must put off the desire to work, to build wealth, and to become successful. Yes, one can work and start a business in school, but the schoolwork certainly gets in the way. The ages at which we are in school, primarily late high school through college, are the years in which we are eaten up by that desire to make something of oneself. 
<br>
How, then, are we to accomplish both goals at this stage of our lives; to attain an education, as well as to begin a wealth creation journey to prove our merit and value? It can’t be a job; no one has ever gotten rich from working at a fast-food store. For many, it can’t be a business of your own, be it from lack of ideas, industry knowledge, etc. So, we are left with easily accessible, virtual wealth creation platforms. Yes, I mean Robinhood, Crypto, even sports betting.
<br>
I cannot focus on school. Maybe it is because of ADHD, which we load kids up with medication from the age of 5 to fix. Maybe it is because I am uninterested; after all, this “investment” in school to have a better job seems to include a lot of “fluff” and “empty time”. I don’t have an answer. The only thing I have been able to focus on, my whole life, is investing. Why does this happen?
<br>
Yes, I am confident that my professional job will lead to a comfortable life. That said, who can wait 40 years to reach success? Especially when we see 14-year-olds dancing on Tik Tok making $50 million a year. My hypothesis is as follows: young men have found investing to be their escape route from that slow, painful climb to the top. They have opted out of that system, in exchange for the ability to control their own finances, and in turn, their own life. If I find it painful to read a chapter assigned for homework, why have I spent over 1,000 hours in the last year studying the Bitcoin network, a journey that has made me an expert on the topic? It is because it is my escape route, as I have stated. One day, be it in 1 year, 5 years, or even 10 years, I am believing that I will have rocketed to the top of that financial climb, decades before my slotted time. 
<br>
There are 10’s of thousands of young men, filled with that same desire to succeed, across the world, who are all following the path to an unfulfilling middle management lifestyle. They do not want this, but it is the system in which they are born amongst. That is the reason for this “stock market movement” in my generation. Many will fail and fall back on those traditional careers that the world provides, but most are willing to take a risk to opt out of a broken system.
